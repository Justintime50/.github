# GitHub Community Health Files

Default [GitHub Community Health Files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file) for all my projects.

## Usage

These files will automatically be included in each `Justintime50` repo unless one already exists in a repo (in which case, the local copy will take precidence). Changes made here will be reflected automatically across all projects.

## Styles

I have documented my style guides per language externally which can be found here: https://github.com/Justintime50/styles.
