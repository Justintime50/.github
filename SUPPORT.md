# Support

Looking for support with one of my projects? Simply create an issue on GitHub with as much details as possible and I'll see what I can do.

Want dedicated support? Consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/Justintime50)!

<!-- TODO: Eventually start a Discord server where users can get help -->
